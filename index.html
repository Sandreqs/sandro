         operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can 
         perform generic sets of operations known as programs. 
         These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
          tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that 
          includes the hardware, operating system (main software),
           and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" 
           operation. This term may also refer to a group of 
           computers that are linked and function together, 
           such as a computer network or computer cluster.

        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use 
        computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices 
        like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are
         factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided
          design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal
           <h2 class="margin-left">computers and mobile devices like smartphones. Computers
            power the Internet, which links billions of other 
            computers and users.</h2>
